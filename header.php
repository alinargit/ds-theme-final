    <p>Lorem ipsum is a dummy or placeholder text commonly used in graphic design, publishing, 
        and web development to fill empty spaces in a layout that does not yet have content. 
        It consists of a sequence of Latin words that do not form complete sentences but serve 
        as placeholders until actual content is added.</p>
